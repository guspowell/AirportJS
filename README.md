#Airport Challenge in Javascript

After having done the [airport challenge in Ruby](https://github.com/guspowell/Airport_challenge) I decided to try and replicate it using Javascript as a way of practicing my Javascript.

##Brief
Control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. Finally, every plane must have a status indicating whether it's flying or landed.

#Installation and Testing
Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:guspowell/AirportJS.git
```
Change into the repository:
```
$ cd AirportJS
```
Run the tests:
```
open SpecRunner.html
```
